# Climate Downscaling with AI

This project aims to apply AI-based downscaling methods for climate data, particularly focusing on regional data for Iran. The project involves preprocessing ERA5-Land and CMIP6 data, training a Super-Resolution model, and producing high-resolution climate forecasts.

## Project Structure:
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `models/`: Trained models and checkpoints.
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and prediction.
